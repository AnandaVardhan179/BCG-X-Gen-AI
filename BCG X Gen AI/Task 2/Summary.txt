I successfully completed the BCG GenAI virtual experience, where I developed an AI-powered financial chatbot. This involved understanding client requirements, extracting and preprocessing financial data, developing and training a generative AI model, integrating the model into a user-friendly chatbot interface, and conducting extensive testing and optimization. Finally, I presented the functional chatbot, demonstrating its capabilities and potential benefits for financial analysis and customer service.
